# Reighard-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU!

# About me 
My name is Julie Reighard (she/her) and I am a second-year Healthcare Policy and Management student at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to Heinz College, I was a student at Juniata College where i obtained a B.S. in Accounting and Business Administration. I chose to pursue a Master's degree at CMU because I wanted to enhance my quantative skills and gain a boarder perspective on operations by learning about management. I came into the program with the expectation that I wanted to work in hospital operations or in the insurance industry, however the quantative skills I have learned have geared my interests more towards analytics anq quality improvement. I am currently working as a Beckwith Grant Innovation Intern at UPMC Family Hospice on a project that is focused on reducing 30-day readmissions and hospital mortality. Within my role, I have conducted and presented data analyses to the team of clincial and non-clinical directors. Most of the analyses I present are with charts and graphs made in Excel that has limited my ability to display the information as I had pictured it in my head. 

# What I hope to learn
I have focused my course work this semester on strengthening my technical skills in analytics. I realized that analytics is only as strong as how it is presented such that the viewer is able to clearly understand it. With that being said, in this course I hope to learn how to engage an audience with visuals that incite both thought-provoking conversation and concision. Overall, I hope to learn a variety of tools that provide better visualization than Microsoft Excel's graph feauture.
