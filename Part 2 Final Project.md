Process:
From the last iteration of this project, I have decided to change my approach because this topic is done frequently, and it could use more attention. Additionally, because this topic is often overdone, I wanted to narrow my topic from overall alcohol abuse for every age level to the relationship between alcohol and social media. Essentially, what I want to show here is how young adults can appear flawless and nonchalant with alcohol in their pictures when there is a deep-seated issue that is ignored. 
My basis for this visualization will be based on research articles from the NIH as a data source and a SELF article that inspired this data visualization and more directed call to action. The focus is on those who have developed an alcohol addiction but their presence on social media does not show the downsides of alcohol but the positive images that can be associated with it.
To guide the story, I will use pictures of people who have alcohol in their photos but the photos could not suggest that the person photograph has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. My call to action will be to challenge people to question those who may fit this profile and how to offer help whether it is resources or tips/strategies.
An empowering statistic to lead the story is that: “One in every 12 adults abuse or depend on alcohol, and it's the third ‘leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the nation’”. I plan to use this statistic to show the gravity of alcohol dependence and its role in our lives as young adults.

Because I chose to switch gears, here is the new storyboard/arc/wireframe that I have come up with:



I used  the sketches to guide my creation of the shorthand website with more specific data point to show to the users for feedback.

Interview Process: Due to the timing of the holiday and the due date of this assignment, I asked my closet family members and roommates to critique my current story and visualization. Of those who will be critiquing is one of my fellow Heinz students (who has not taken this course), my brother who is a full time architectural engineer and part-time critic and my father who is a businessman that focuses on the facts and figures. I chose these people because they come from a variety of industries/backgrounds as well as age groups and experience. 

Questions Asked:

•	Who do you think this information is geared towards?

•	How does the story flow?

•	Does the data coincide with the message? Is this clear?

•	Is this visually appealing? What could use improvement?

•	Is the call to action clear and easily identified?

Interview Findings:
Feedback 1:
  1. This information appears geared toward a variety of audiences including prospective college students, students in college, and parents of college-aged children, among others.
2. Overall, the story goes well except for the fact that there is a considerable change in tone starting with the change in topic from students exhibiting academic consequences of excessive drinking to alcohol-related deaths. The change is rough and abrupt; however, may work well in the context of the storyboard.
3. The data, in combination with the use of anecdotal stories works well to convey the message. However, the graphic used that contrasts alcohol-related deaths with assaults and sexual assaults does not work well as it shows the deaths involved with alcohol as being so little compared to the other two categories. I would suggest finding a graphic that emphasizes alcoholic deaths in another context. The data is clear in the message, yet the choice to change graphics may help even more.
4. It is visually appealing up until the majority of the text (with the white backgrounds) appears; nevertheless, you may just have to roll with the punches with that as I do not necessarily see a way to vastly improve that.
5. Yes the call to action is clear from the start to finish

Feedback 2:
1) I think this information is geared towards young adults / college aged individuals. 
2) I think the story flows well, but could use some sort of statistic as to how social media influences the act of drinking. I think the introduction sets a great tone but there’s not much mention of the social media influence throughout. 
3) I think the data relates to the topic well, and the TED talk is a great resource that paves the way for your information. The statistics about alcohol consumption is certainly alarming. 
4) This layout is fantastic, especially viewed on mobile. Great use of relevant images. I would suggest utilizing a different graph for the “Enabler” section, only to highlight the number of alcohol-related deaths, as it seems very minuscule. Additionally, I would provide some clarification on what that graph details, such as a year or ages of affected individuals. 
5) I think the call to action is presented in a clean and straightforward manner, and love the use of hotline numbers and resources as a conclusion. 

Feedback 3: 
1.	Young adults particularly those of age 21 or older.
2.	The story flows very well, but some transitions could be smoother
3.	The data aligns very well with the topic. It shows relevant statistics
4.	It is visually appealing, but maybe use a brighter color for the dark pictures at the beginning. 
5.	It is clear and easily identified. Alcohol abuse is a much bigger problem than I ever would have imagined

Changes to be made:
•	Enabler Section: Strengthen here. More compelling and specific datapoints for the consequences of alcohol at different stages of life (consequences from drinking in college, middle age to long term-chronic conditions)

•	More specific data points that show the gravity of the problem because death is a small number for the 18-24 age groups

•	Transition of social media to college students to flow smoother. Explain more about the psychology/background that social media can play into habits and choices.

•	Flow and explain the data more that can allow for smoother transitions for the different age groups. 

•	Mainly work on transiiton/connection between teenagers and college aged/young adults. Replicate/find stories that match the horror stories you hear about when students go to college.
